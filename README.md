## Engine Guide

**Engine Concept**

The lychee.js Core consists of the Asset, Definition,
Package and Environment that allows isomorphic behaviour
via Feature Detection and Feature Prediction.

- [Code Rules](./engine-concept/Code-Rules.md)
- [Assets](./engine-concept/Assets.md)
- [Definitions](./engine-concept/Definitions.md)
- [Feature Detection](./engine-concept/Feature-Detection.md)
- Feature Prediction
- [Environments](./engine-concept/Environments.md)
- Serialization
- Fertilizers

**Project Architecture**

The lychee.js Engine can handle both Projects and
Libraries. All lychee.js Projects can be used as
Libraries and vice versa.

- [Package Format](./project-architecture/Package-Format.md)
- Project Structure
- Build System Integrations
- Software Bot Integrations

**Engine Architecture**

The lychee.js Engine (app / ui namespace) is the
underlying architecture for an Application. It also
offers default behaviours and integrations with all
platform adapters right out of the box.

- MAIN Architecture
- Fertilizer Adapters
- Timeline Graph
- Event Graph
- Scene Graph
- Network Graph
- AI Graph

**Software Bots**

The lychee.js Software Bots allow easier cultivation
of lychee.js Projects by offering automation tools
and solutions.

- lychee.js Breeder
- [lychee.js Helper](./software-bots/lycheejs-helper.md)
- lychee.js Harvester
- lychee.js Fertilizer
- lychee.js Editor
