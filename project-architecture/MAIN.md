# MAIN Architecture

The `app.Main` instance of each project
offers a convenient way to integrate
Platform Adapters with zero lines of
platform-specific code.

Remember: The main goal of each Project
is to eliminate platform-specific code
as far as possible. Move platform-specific
code into Libraries to have reusable
Definitions that can be reused among
multiple Projects.
