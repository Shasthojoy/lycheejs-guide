# Feature Detection

The lychee.js Definitions allow to have feature
detection capabilities which are analysed at
runtime and can be injected at runtime.


## Sandboxes

## Basic Concept

Any Definition is cross-platform and cross-portable.
That means every Definition is loaded and evaluated
based on the current `lychee.environment`'s settings
and tags.

Any environment can be built and simulated in any
runtime, so each Definition has to define its own
requirements.

If the Definition is a non-generic Definition, it
has to fullfill the `supports()` and `tags()` API
in order to be mapped correctly by the environment.


## Definition Tags

Each Definition can have multiple tags, where tags
in combination represent the featureset that the
final lychee.js Library or Project wants to deliver.
By default, the [Environments](./Environments.md)
and [Fertilizers](./Fertilizers.md) are only
respecting the `platform` tag.

All tags can inherit featuresets from other tags
automatically by using a `-` divider, for example
is the `html-nwjs` incrementelly inheriting from
`html`.

That allows to arrange tags and features without
the duplication of adapters.

Custom tags are freely nameable, but it is
recommended to not name it `platform`, as this
would require to have multiple adapters for
multiple runtimes and would require additions to
the Fertilizer build chain.


## Basic Example

This is a basic example for a custom `app.Renderer`
using a platform-specific canvas API that is not
available on other platforms than `html`.


```javascript
lychee.define('app.Renderer').includes([
	'lychee.Renderer'
]).tags({
	platform: 'html'
}).supports(function(lychee, global) {

	// XXX: typeof CanvasRenderingContext is
	// > object in Safari
	// > function everywhere else

	if (
		typeof global.document !== 'undefined'
		&& typeof global.document.createElement === 'function'
		&& typeof global.CanvasRenderingContext2D !== 'undefined'
	) {

		return true;

	}


	return false;

}).exports(function(lychee, global, attachments) {

	var _document = global.document;



	/*
	 * IMPLEMENTATION
	 */

	var Composite = function(data) {

		var settings = Object.assign({}, data);


		this.__canvas  = _document.createElement('canvas');
		this.__context = this.__canvas.getContext('2d');

		settings = null;

	};


	Composite.prototype = {

	};


	return Composite;

});
```



## Package Integration

All `lychee.pkg` files have a `source/tags/<tag>/<value>`
map where the `tag` for the above Definition is `platform`
and the `value` is `html`.

The equivalent file path is `platform/html`, which means
that there are multiple `app.Renderer` Definitions available
inside the `./projects/example/source/platform/*/` folders.

Here's an example `lychee.pkg` file that contains the above
example, offering an alternative Renderer for the `node`
platform tag.

```json
{
	"build": {},
	"source": {
		"environments": {},
		"tags": {
			"platform": {
				"html": "platform/html",
				"node": "platform/node"
			}
		},
		"files": {
			"platform": {
				"html": {
					"Renderer": [ "js" ]
				},
				"node": {
					"Renderer": [ "js" ]
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
